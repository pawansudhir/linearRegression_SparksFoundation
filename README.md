# linearRegression_SparksFoundation
###  Simple Linear regression using pandas, matplotib, numpy and seaborn to predict scores based on past data.
This project develops basic understanding of how linear regression can be used to predict scores based on past data without using machine learning. This contains pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib libraries. This code takes one through numpy statistical functions, deviations etc to find regression coefficients for predicting the score employing the priciple of least squares
